      "- Bacteria\n",
      "- Parasites \n",
      "- Viruses\n",
      "- Environmental factors like metals, smoking, alcohol, electromagnetic radiation\n",
      "- Physical inactivity\n",
      "- Reproductive hormones\n",
      "- Diet and physical activity [1] 2. Environmental Factors:\n",
      "- Metals: While trace levels of metals are necessary nutrients, at higher concentrations they can be hazardous to living cells. Metals can act as both endocrine disruptors and carcinogens, causing hormonal disruption and malignant transformation. [2] - Smoking: Cigarette smoking has been linked to a wide range of neoplastic illnesses. Smokers have a higher relative chance of dying from cancers of lung, pancreas, head and neck, urinary system and bladder. [3] - Alcohol: There is a causative relationship between alcohol intake and cancers of the oral cavity, throat, esophagus, liver, rectum, larynx, colon and breast cancer among women. [4] - Radiation: Studies have found that exposure from moderately to high concentration may cause the majority of cancer, leukaemia, pulmonary, breast, thyroid malignancies, particularly at young age exposure to radiation. [5] 3. Occupational Factors: Occupational exposure to carcinogens can lead to malignant tumors. In developed countries, it is estimated that one in three people will acquire cancer at some point in their life. The transfer of hazardous businesses is also putting developing countries at risk. [6] 4. Hormonal Factors: Hormones play a key role in developing some of the world's most frequent cancers, including endometrial, breast, and ovarian cancers in women, and prostate cancer in men. Hormones are thought to influence cancer risk through affecting the pace of cell division and differentiation, and amount of vulnerable cells. [7] 5. Diet: Diet has an important role in causing cancers like breast and colon cancer. It has been predicted that intake of healthy food with good dietary fiber can prevent chances of all types of cancer. Low fibers in diet and imbalance between concentration of Omega-3 and Omega-6 fats increase cancer risk. This can be prevented by intake of vegetables and fruits which contain vitamin B12, selenium and antioxidants such as carotenoids. [8]\n",
