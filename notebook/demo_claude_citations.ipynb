Research has also linked smoking to increased risk of leukemia and myeloma [3] - Alcohol: Has been causatively linked to cancers of the oral cavity, throat, esophagus, liver, rectum, larynx, colon and breast cancer in women [4] - Radiation: Intensive epidemiological studies have found that exposure from moderate to high concentrations may cause the majority of cancer, particularly leukemia, pulmonary, breast, and thyroid malignancies, especially with youthful exposure to radiation [5] 3. Occupational Factors:\n",
      "- Occupational exposure to carcinogens can lead to malignant tumors. In developed countries, it's estimated that one in three people will acquire cancer at some point in their life. The transfer of hazardous businesses is also putting developing countries at risk. While occupational cancers are treated the same as non-occupational ones, identifying them is critical for public health since they are preventable [6] 4. Hormonal Factors:\n",
      "- Hormones play a key role in some of the world's most frequent cancers, including endometrial, breast, and ovarian cancers in women, and prostate cancer in men. They are thought to influence cancer risk by affecting the pace of cell division and differentiation, and the amount of vulnerable cells [7] 5. Diet and Physical Activity:\n",
      "- Diet plays an important role in causing cancers like breast and colon cancer. It's predicted that intake of healthy food with good dietary fiber can prevent chances of all types of cancer. Low fiber diets and imbalance between Omega-3 and Omega-6 fats increase cancer risk. This can be prevented by intake of vegetables and fruits which contain vitamin B12, selenium and antioxidants such as carotenoids [8] The document emphasizes that cancer has become a drastic condition, and understanding its causes, mechanisms and how it can increase with other factors has become important for prevention and management [9] .\n",

      "1. Shared Epigenetic Factors: Genetic risk factors contribute ~30% to lifetime risk of developing knee OA. Previous studies have identified methylation quantitative trait loci co-localizing with OA risk SNVs (OA-mQTLs). This interplay between DNA sequence and methylation status has been shown to underpin tissue-specific mechanisms of cartilage gene expression. [1] 2. Early Life Epigenetic Patterns: A targeted study investigating OA-mQTLs in developing human limbs at 7 well-characterized loci found that 85% of the OA mQTLs also operated in fetal tissues. [2] 3. Post-Surgical Pain Prediction: Researchers identified 210 differentially methylated candidate gene promoters in surgical super-responders relative to non-responders. Thirty-four of these candidate promoters had greater than 1.5-fold difference in methylation status, and twelve were associated with inflammatory or neurological processes or diseases. [3] 4. Clinical Applications: Scientists have identified an epigenetic biosignature associated with recovery/non-recovery from pain following surgery for LSS due to facet OA. Using this biosignature, they have determined a biologically plausible candidate E-PRS that may enable a personalized/precision medicine approach to accurately identify spine OA patients that are likely to benefit from surgery. [4] 5. Ongoing Research: Current efforts are focused on further validating the E-PRS's predictive ability in a larger cohort. [5] This evidence suggests that there is indeed overlap between epigenomic marks associated with OA susceptibility and post-surgical pain development, though the full extent and clinical implications are still being investigated.\n",
